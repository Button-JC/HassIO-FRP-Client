## Home Assistant OS FRP Client
[FRP](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) Client for Home Assistant OS can be used to set up a reverse proxy with an FRP server.

FRP can be used to bypass port forwarding for home assistant. Install a remote server (On a server where port forwarding is allowed). And then connect through the client to the server of FRP.

This tool is able to do the configuration of Home Assistant automatically. With options for authentication, encryption and compression.
